# Getting Started with Headphones: Budget Bluetooth Tierlist

If you're just starting to explore Bluetooth headphones and don't want to spend a lot, there are quite a few decent options under **100 SGD**. I went through several models, testing some across music genres, calls, and daily use, and here's how I'd rank them.

This list is based on my personal experience — I focused on **comfort, ANC, sound profile, and build quality**. All prices were around or below 100 SGD at time of testing.

## 🎧 The Tierlist

**S-Tier (Best overall in the range)**  
- **🎖️ Edifier W830NB**  
  > Surprisingly good ANC and a balanced sound profile. Great comfort and battery life. Slightly bulky but worth it. These are my personal favourites.

**A-Tier (Very good for the price)**  
- **UGREEN HiTune Max5 (Hi5C)**  
  > Good clarity, decent ANC, and very comfortable. Build is a bit plasticky but audio is solid. This is the best cheap buy in my honest opinion, going for under 40 SGD. 
- **EarFun Wave Pro**  
  > Balanced tuning, decent ANC, good app support. Not flashy, but does a lot right.

**B-Tier (Good but with trade-offs)**  
- **Soundcore Q30**  
  > Bass-heavy profile. Good ANC for the price but can get a bit muddy. Comfy.  
- **JLab Lux ANC**  
  > Decent all-rounder. Build quality is okay, tuning leans warm. Slight hiss in ANC mode. However, I really love the look of these, they come across as very unique and well built.

**C-Tier (Useable, but consider alternatives)**  
- **Soundcore Q20**  
  > Big and clunky, but gets the job done. Very bassy. Limited features and no app.  
- **Sony WH-CH520**  
  > Great battery, clean mids. But no ANC and plastic build. Fine for calls or podcasts, not music-first.

## 🔍 Notes & Tips

- Don't expect flagship ANC or LDAC at this price — but you can still get surprisingly usable sound.
- Comfort and weight matter more than you'd think, especially for long Zoom calls or commutes.
- If you're picky about tuning, some of these models have **EQ customization via app**.

If you're on a tight budget or just dipping your toes into wireless audio, any of the S or A-tier options here are solid starting points. I'd personally go with the **Edifier W830NB** if you want a good all-rounder with real ANC, or the **UGREEN Hi5C** if you want something slimmer and lighter.

# From Hardware to Software: My Transition Story

During my time working on hardware — whether that was PCB design, electronics, or robotics — I started noticing a shift around me. A lot of people were diving into AI, machine learning, and web development. More and more roles, even in hardware-focused companies, were asking for experience with software: data pipelines, scripting, Python, and general coding fluency.

At the time, my main software exposure was in C for embedded work. But I realized that wasn’t going to be enough if I wanted to keep up with the direction things were moving in. So, I started branching out.

## Starting Off

The first high-level language I touched beyond C was **Julia**, mainly through coursework and curiosity. I liked its syntax and speed, especially for numerical computing.

That slowly led into **MATLAB** and **Python**, especially during research projects at university. A lot of simulation and data analysis work naturally pushed me toward using Python libraries like 'pandas', 'matplotlib', and 'scikit-learn'.

## Expanding the Scope

Once I was more comfortable with scripting, I started experimenting with other areas — some machine learning, random Python projects, and a bit of full-stack development (Next.js, Tailwind, etc.). I wouldn't say I had a specific focus at the time; I was just trying to get familiar with the tools I saw being used by peers and in job descriptions.

## Reflections

I still approach problems with a hardware-first mindset — thinking about systems, constraints, and physical realities. But I've come to appreciate how software lets you test, break, and iterate faster.

It wasn't a dramatic shift, just a gradual process of recognizing that I needed to pick up new tools. And over time, that built up into a more balanced skill set.

## Where I Am Now

I still work with hardware, but software now plays a much bigger role in how I build, test, and think through problems. I wouldn't call myself a software engineer, but I'm a lot more comfortable working across both sides — and that's been useful.

# Getting Started with DACs: What They Are and Two Budget Picks

If you've been getting into headphones or audio gear, you’ve probably come across the term **DAC**. But what exactly is it, and do you really need one?

## 🧠 What is a DAC?

A **DAC**, or **Digital-to-Analog Converter**, is a small chip or device that turns digital audio (like the ones from your phone or laptop) into an analog signal that headphones can actually use.

Every device with a headphone jack already has a built-in DAC — but not all DACs are created equal. A **dedicated DAC** usually offers:

- Cleaner audio
- Better separation and detail
- More power (especially important for higher-impedance headphones)
- Support for better Bluetooth codecs (if it’s a Bluetooth DAC)

If you're using **budget wired headphones**, upgrading your DAC can give you better clarity, especially in mids and highs.

## 🎧 Bluetooth DAC/Amp Picks Under ~70 SGD

Here are two beginner-friendly options I tried that offer good performance for the price:

### 🔹 HiBy W3 II

- **Connection:** Bluetooth and USB-C DAC  
- **Codecs supported:** LDAC, aptX HD, AAC, SBC  
- **Battery life:** ~10 hours  
- **Power:** Drives most IEMs and budget headphones fine  
- **Design:** Lightweight with a clip, OLED display

**Thoughts:**  
This one is super compact and convenient. It works well as both a Bluetooth DAC and a wired USB DAC.

### 🔹 FiiO BTR11

- **Connection:** Bluetooth and USB-C DAC  
- **Codecs supported:** LDAC, aptX, AAC  
- **Battery life:** ~8 hours  
- **Power:** Slightly lower output than W3 II, but good for IEMs  
- **Design:** Minimal, metal housing, volume buttons, comes with clip

**Thoughts:**  
More minimal than the W3 II. No display, but it's compact and reliable. Slightly cleaner and flatter tuning than the HiBy. If you want something simple that "just works," this is a solid pick. Doesn't drive power-hungry cans, but fine for SHP9500 or Koss KSC75.

---

## 🧩 Final Thoughts

You don't need a DAC to enjoy music — but if you're starting to care about **audio quality, detail, and clarity**, a small upgrade like this makes a real difference. Both of these models are:

- Portable
- Great for people just stepping into higher-quality audio

I'd recommend the **HiBy W3 II** if you like extra features (it also functions as a wired usb DAC which is great!) and the display, or the **FiiO BTR11** if you want something simpler and sleeker.

If you want to check out other models, there is the moondrop dawn pro and the qudelix 5k which I have seen people rave about.

# Getting Started with Headphones: Wired Options Under 100 SGD

Wired headphones still offer excellent value and fidelity if you're okay with using a DAC or a headphone jack. Here's a roundup of solid wired options I tested or researched that punch above their price.

## 🎧 The Tierlist

**S-Tier (High-value, balanced sound)**  
- **🎖️ Superlux HD681**  
  > Semi-open design with a wide soundstage. Slightly harsh treble out of the box but great detail for the price.  
  > Great for casual gaming or beginner mixing on a budget.

- **🎖️ Philips SHP9500**  
  > Comfortable, neutral, wide-stage. Open-back, so not ideal for noisy environments, but excellent clarity.

**A-Tier (Very solid all-rounders)**  
- **Philips SHP9600**  
  > A bit warmer and bassier than the SHP9500. Bigger drivers, similar comfort. Slightly more consumer-friendly tuning. Personally, these are what I am using.
- **Sennheiser HD400S**  
  > Closed-back. Clean mids, slightly dark but good for vocal-focused music. Compact and portable.  

**B-Tier (Good but niche appeal)**  
- **Koss KSC75**  
  > Legendary clip-on budget headphones. Very open, airy sound, but poor isolation. Great for casual home listening or modding.  

## 🔍 Notes

- Open-back models like SHP9500 and HD681 give better clarity but leak sound.
- Most of these need a bit of clean amplification (a basic DAC or interface helps).
- Comfort and cable length vary — SHP9500 has one of the best stock headbands.

---

For wired use under 100 SGD, I'd recommend the **SHP9500** for clarity and comfort or the **Superlux HD681** for soundstage and raw value. The **Koss KSC75** is a fun outlier if you're okay with modding or want a super lightweight pair for home use.
